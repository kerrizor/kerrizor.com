    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By Internet standards, MongoDB is a venerable NoSQL database. <!-- more -->First introduced in 2009, it was designed as a scalable document storage engine. In Mongo, we don&rsquo;t work with tables and rows, we work with <strong>collections</strong> and <strong>documents</strong>. Documents contain JSON/BSON hashes, so any data that can be represented as a hash can be stored in Mongo. Mongo is a <strong>schemaless</strong> database, meaning there&rsquo;s no requirements nor enforcement about the structure of the data in a document.</p>

<p>Mongo is able to handle massive data sets quickly and efficiently, and is used by many big data organizations, including Foursquare, bit.ly, and CERN for collecting Large Hadron Collider data.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>This is fairly straight forward using homebrew.</p>

<p><code>ruby
$ brew install mongodb
</code></p>

<p>When it finishes, it will print out some information on setting up Mongo to start whenever you start your computer. I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of that. Here&rsquo;s what I use:</p>

<p><code>ruby
$ brew services start mongodb
</code></p>

<p>..and to stop it:</p>

<p><code>ruby
$ brew services stop mongodb
</code></p>

<h2>Mongo and Rails</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make a new Rails application, but specify that we do NOT want Active Record installed.</p>

<p><code>
$ rails new mongo-people --skip-active-record
</code></p>

<p><code>cd</code> into the project, and edit the Gemfile, add this line:</p>

<p><code>ruby
gem "mongoid", git: 'git://github.com/mongoid/mongoid.git'
</code></p>

<p>Save, and then run</p>

<p><code>
$ bundle install
</code></p>

<p>Just as when using a relational DB such as SQLite, Postgres, or MySQL, we need a configuration file. Mongoid installs a custom Rails generator for us. Run:</p>

<p><code>
$ rails generate mongoid:config
</code></p>

<p>Open up the file it creates, located at <code>config/mongoid.yml</code> and take a look. Take note of the different options we <em>could</em> configure. Don&rsquo;t make any changes at this time; its enough to just take a look at what the generator created on our behalf.</p>

<p>At this point, I like to run <code>rails s</code> and make sure the server starts, that everything is all hunkey-dorey. Once you&rsquo;ve checked in a browser that Rails is at least starting up correctly, let&rsquo;s make a new git repo and check in what we&rsquo;ve got so far.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get started. Since this is a demonstration, let&rsquo;s cheat a little bit and use Rails' scaffolding generators to get us started.</p>

<p><code>
$ rails generate scaffold person name street city state
</code></p>

<p>Use <code>git status</code> to see what the command generated. It should all look pretty normal.. but let&rsquo;s take a look at the model it generated.</p>

<p><code>ruby
class Person
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :name, type: String
  field :street, type: String
  field :city, type: String
  field :state, type: String
end
</code></p>

<p>Quite different! MongoDB doesn&rsquo;t have a database schema, so no database migrations are needed. If we want a new field, we could just declare one in the model and add it to our views. Migrations are occasionally used, but they&rsquo;re for data migration or transformation, not changing the structure of the database.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s fire up our Rails server and visit the scaffolded route (at <code>http://localhost:3000/people</code>) There we see the vanilla Rails CRUD forms. Let&rsquo;s add a person.. and look at the URL in the show page &ndash; weird! We&rsquo;re used to seeing incrementing IDs created for us by the database. Each row that is added to the table increments the row counter by exactly 1, so we might say that each row has a locally unique sequential identifier.</p>

<p>MongoDB uses these weird looking hashes of alphanumerics like &ldquo;532e2ba7546f6c30aa000000&rdquo;. This <strong>Object ID</strong> is always 12 bytes, composed of a timestamp, client machine id, client process id, and a 3-byte incremented counter.</p>

<h2>Documents</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what a document looks like.</p>

<p>You may have seen command line interfaces for PostgreSQL, so it shouldn&rsquo;t come as a shock that MongoDB offers one as well. In a terminal window:</p>

<p><code>
$ mongo mongo_people_development
</code></p>

<p>Note that I found the name of our database by looking at <code>config/mongoid.yml</code>.</p>

<p>Mongo uses its own special command language for working with its data. If you get stuck, just type <code>help</code>.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s take a look at the collections in this database.
```javascript</p>

<blockquote><p>show collections
people
system.indexes</p>

<p>```</p></blockquote>

<p>To find a record, the format is <code>db.[collection].find()</code></p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<blockquote><p>db.people.find()
{ &ldquo;<em>id&rdquo; : ObjectId(&ldquo;532e2ba7546f6c30aa000000&rdquo;), &ldquo;name&rdquo; : &ldquo;Kerri Miller&rdquo;, &ldquo;street&rdquo; : &ldquo;123 Main Street&rdquo;, &ldquo;city&rdquo; : &ldquo;SEATTLE&rdquo;, &ldquo;state&rdquo; : &ldquo;WA&rdquo; }
db.people.find({&ldquo;state&rdquo;:&ldquo;WA&rdquo;})
{ &ldquo;</em>id&rdquo; : ObjectId(&ldquo;532e2ba7546f6c30aa000000&rdquo;), &ldquo;name&rdquo; : &ldquo;Kerri Miller&rdquo;, &ldquo;street&rdquo; : &ldquo;123 Main Street&rdquo;, &ldquo;city&rdquo; : &ldquo;SEATTLE&rdquo;, &ldquo;state&rdquo; : &ldquo;WA&rdquo; }</p>

<p>```</p></blockquote>

<p>Note that the first command returned ALL documents in the collection, we just happened to only have one document, so that&rsquo;s all that was returned.</p>

<p>Remember when I said that MongoDB stores everything as JSON? Mongo actually uses JavaScript here in the command line.</p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<blockquote><p>typeof db
object
typeof db.people
object
typeof db.people.find
function</p>

<p>```</p></blockquote>

<p>If we want to see what the code for a Mongo command looks like, we can call the function without parenthesis.</p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<blockquote><p>db.people.find
function ( query , fields , limit , skip, batchSize, options ){</p>

<pre><code>var cursor = new DBQuery( this._mongo , this._db , this ,
                    this._fullName , this._massageObject( query ) , fields , limit , skip , batchSize , options || this.getQueryOptions() );
</code></pre></blockquote>

<pre><code>var connObj = this.getMongo();
var readPrefMode = connObj.getReadPrefMode();
if (readPrefMode != null) {
    cursor.readPref(readPrefMode, connObj.getReadPrefTagSet());
}

return cursor;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<blockquote><p>```</p></blockquote>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<h3>Why MongoDB?</h3>

<p>MongoDB is designed to be highly-scalable and flexible, but remain familiar enough that application developers could use it easily. Working with Mongo is mostly the same as working with a traditional RDBMS (except for being unable to do server-side JOINs between two sets of data..)</p>

<p>Because it can&rsquo;t do server-side JOINs, the relationships between different objects (Users have Posts, Posts have Comments, Comments have Users) can be tricky, as you need to set up those relationships in the model.</p>

<h3>Why not MongoDB?</h3>

<p>How MongoDB encourages denormalization of schemas (by not having any) might be a little too much for some to swallow. Some developers find the cold, hard constraints of a relational database reassuring.</p>

<p>Although sometimes restrictive, a database schema and the restraints it places on our data can be reassuring and useful. While MongoDB offers a huge increase in scalability and speed of record retrieval, its inability to relate documents from 2 different collections &mdash; the key strength of a RDBMS &mdash; makes it often not the best case for a CRUD-focused web application.</p>

<p>Because MongoDB is focused on large datasets, it works best in large clusters, which can be a pain to design and manage.</p>

    <link href="http://kerrizor.com/blog/2014/03/31/rails-internationalization-i18n/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-31T12:01:32-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kerrizor.com/blog/2014/03/31/rails-internationalization-i18n</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rails by default installs support for internationalization (or <em>I18n</em>) through the gem <code>i18n</code>. This gem add support for multiple language dictionaries and translation files, to let you easily change the language your site displays.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As you can imagine, I18n is a complex problem, since human languages differ in so many ways (pluralization, grammar, etc.) The Rails I18n API isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it does a fairly good job focusing on supporting English and other similar languages, and provides a framework to add support for languages that fall outside the paradigm of those (Japanese, Tagalog, or Hebrew, for example.)</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s build a new Rails app and create a simple &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; page.</p>

<p><code>
$ rails new i18n_demo
$ cd i18n_demo
$ rails g controller welcome
</code>
I add a simple <code>views/welcome/index.html.erb</code> template, and we get a page that says &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;. Now, let&rsquo;s use a translation dictionary to render this string.</p>

<p><em>welcome.html.erb</em>:
<code>erb
&lt;%= t(:hello) %&gt;
</code></p>

<p><em>config/locales/en.yml</em>:
<code>yml
en:
  hello: "Hello world"
</code></p>

<p>We reload the page, and magic! Rails loads the string from the translation file.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s set this app up to give us this page in French. First, let&rsquo;s make a new translations file:</p>

<p><em>config/locales/fr.yml</em>:
<code>yml
fr:
  hello: "Bonjour!"
</code></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a variety of ways to tell our Rails application we want to change from the default language (which is English.) For the purposes of this demonstration, we&rsquo;ll use a simple query string.</p>

<p><em>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</em>:
```ruby
before_action :set_locale</p>

<p>def set_locale
  I18n.locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale
end
```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s restart our server, and append <code>?locale=fr</code> to our URL and see what happens.</p>

<p>Awesome!</p>

<p>We could define a translation file for any language; we&rsquo;re not limited to just the 2 letter language abbreviations!</p>

<p><em>config/locales/pirate.yml</em>:
<code>yml
pirate:
  hello: "Ahoy mateys!"
</code></p>

<p>By starting with I18n early in an app, its fairly easy to add new language support to your application. Generally its a matter of taking an existing translations file and sending it to a translator to interpret the strings for you, then adding it to your repo.</p>

<p>Of course, nothing is ever that simple.</p>

<h2>Interpolation</h2>

<p>What if we wanted to greet a user by name?</p>

<p><em>config/locales/en.yml</em>:
<code>yml
en:
  hello_name: 'Hello, %{name}!'
</code></p>

<p><em>app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</em>:
<code>erb
&lt;%= t(:hello_name, name: "Kerri") %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re just putting a string in here, but it could easily be a value from an object. For example:</p>

<p><code>erb
&lt;%= t(:hello_name, name: current_user.name) %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>While this solution generally works fine, you may be able to already see how this is potentially a sticky situation, depending on the language!</p>

<h2>Pluralization</h2>

<p>The other situation that comes up that causes some problems is pluralization.</p>

<p><em>config/locales/en.yml</em>:
<code>yml
inbox:
  zero: 'You have no messages'
  one: 'You have one message'
  other: 'You have %{count} messages'
</code></p>

<p><em>app/views/welcome/index.html.erb</em>:
<code>erb
&lt;%= t(:inbox, count: 2) %&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Magic!</p>
