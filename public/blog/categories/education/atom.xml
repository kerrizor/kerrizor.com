    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that I explicitly try to model when I&rsquo;m teaching people is the idea that There Ain&rsquo;t No Such Thing As An Expert. <!-- more -->There are precious few people who know everything inside and out, and rather than try to puff myself up as some sort of magical repository of wisdom, it&rsquo;s better to model for students how to react to moments of discovering your knowledge isn&rsquo;t perfect, how to turn a surprise into a learning opportunity.</p>

<p>I often do Ruby training classes for groups and individuals, both for those who are new to Ruby as well as those who want to dive deeper into specific topics. During one of these training sessions, I loaded this chunk of Ruby into IRB:</p>

<p>```ruby
class Parent
  def speak</p>

<pre><code>puts "Pick up your room!"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>class Child &lt; Parent
end
```</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m defining a <code>Parent</code> class with one instance method <code>speak</code> and a <code>Child</code> class that inherits from <code>Parent</code>, then I showed the students how method inheritance works in practice.</p>

<p><code>ruby
2.2.2 :009 &gt; Parent.new.speak
Pick up your room!
 =&gt; nil
2.2.2 :010 &gt; Child.new.speak
Pick up your room!
 =&gt; nil
</code></p>

<p>Next, I wanted to show how we could redefine the <code>speak</code> method for <code>Child</code>. As this was a group who, though junior, had previously developed in Java, I also wanted to show off a tiny bit of the Ruby magic, by accomplishing this not by restarting and loading up the objects again, but by reopening the class. Now, normally if I were to do that, I&rsquo;d type it in like this:</p>

<p><code>ruby
2.2.2 :011 &gt; class Child &lt; Parent
2.2.2 :012?&gt;   def speak
2.2.2 :013?&gt;     puts "YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME!"
2.2.2 :014?&gt;   end
2.2.2 :015?&gt; end
 =&gt; :speak
2.2.2 :016 &gt; Child.new.speak
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME!
 =&gt; nil
</code></p>

<p>However, in my excitement to show how cool Ruby is, what I actually did was make a critical typo:</p>

<p><code>ruby
2.2.2 :017 &gt; Child &lt; Parent
 =&gt; true
</code></p>

<p>Wait, what?! Child is /less/ than Parent? That&rsquo;s interesting. Why would it be less than Parent? I was in the middle of a class, and didn&rsquo;t want to derail, so I quickly said &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting! I want to explore this later, hang on..&rdquo; As someone whose attention is easily diverted, I&rsquo;ve found having the code equivalent of a little notebook to jot down my thoughts, ideas, and questions to help me focus on the problem at hand rather than rabbit holes, so I keep a little folder of notes (backed by git) of interesting things.</p>

<p>So, questionable code captured, I as able to return to it later that evening. What was going on? Now, I know that all objects in Ruby have their own unique ID. Could that be what we&rsquo;re comparing?</p>

<p><code>ruby
2.2.2 :021 &gt; Child.object_id
 =&gt; 70157984875120
2.2.2 :022 &gt; Parent.object_id
 =&gt; 70157984897760
2.2.2 :023 &gt; Child.object_id &lt; Parent.object_id
 =&gt; true
</code></p>

<p>Possibly, except that I know that <code>&lt;</code>, just like <code>+</code>, is actually a method.</p>

<p><code>ruby
2.2.2 :024 &gt; 2.+(3)
 =&gt; 5
2.2.2 :025 &gt; 2 + 3
 =&gt; 5
2.2.2 :026 &gt; 2.+(3)
 =&gt; 5
2.2.2 :027 &gt; 2 &lt; 3
 =&gt; true
2.2.2 :028 &gt; 2.&lt;(3)
 =&gt; true
2.2.2 :029 &gt; Child.object_id.&lt;(Parent.object_id)
 =&gt; true
</code></p>

<p>It is only a syntactic convenience that we&rsquo;re able to use these operators in a more human friendly manner. So, when I&rsquo;m testing <code>Child.object_id &lt; Parent.object_id</code> my use of <code>&lt;</code> is a method on the object returned by <code>object_id</code>, which in this case if a FixNum.</p>

<p><code>ruby
2.2.2 :030 &gt; Child.object_id.class
 =&gt; Fixnum
</code></p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m comparing one class to another, I&rsquo;m using not some magical concept of &ldquo;less than&rdquo; that Ruby is aware of, but I&rsquo;m calling a method upon the return value of the previous method. Thankfully, Ruby offers us the ability to inquire where a given method is defined.</p>

<p><code>ruby
2.2.2 :031 &gt; Child.new.method(:speak).owner
 =&gt; Parent
2.2.2 :019 &gt; Child.method(:&lt;).owner
 =&gt; Module
</code></p>

<p>We see here that <code>speak</code> is defined as a method in <code>Parent</code> and thus handed down via inheritance to a <code>Child</code> instance, and that <code>&lt;</code>, as a class method of <code>Child</code>, is defined in <code>Module</code>.</p>

<p>So what exactly is it comparing? Off to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">http://ruby-doc.org</a> we go! It is a great resource, one that every Ruby developer should have bookmarked. You&rsquo;re not going to remember every single method, or how exactly each method behaves, so being comfortable with this documentation will pay off, and odds are you&rsquo;ll learn something new (or be reminded of something you forgot) every time you browse through it&rsquo;s pages.</p>

<p>Navigating to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Module.html">the page documenting Module</a> I found the following:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>mod &lt; other → true, false, or nil</strong>
Returns true if mod is a subclass of other. Returns nil if there&rsquo;s no relationship between the two. (Think of the relationship in terms of the class definition: “class A&lt;B” implies “A&lt;B”.)</p></blockquote>

<p><em>&mdash; <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Module.html#method-i-3C">Documentation for Module#&lt;</a></em></p>

<p>For our problem, we see that if the Class or Module on the left side of <code>&lt;</code> is a subclass of the Class or Module on the right side, we will get back <code>true</code>. If it is NOT a subclass, we will get back <code>false</code>, and if they&rsquo;re in no way related to each other, we&rsquo;ll get back <code>nil</code>. In the description above, we can see an abstract example to the left of the <em>→</em>, and to the right we see the possible outputs. On the actual Ruby-Docs.org website, you can also mouseover the definition to see a link &ldquo;click to toggle source&rdquo; which will reveal the actual source code that is run when you call the method. If you&rsquo;re curious &mdash; and I encourage you to be so &mdash; take a minute to open it up and see what&rsquo;s going on. You may not be able to write C, but I wager that you can read it and puzzle out how it works.</p>

<p>So this particular bit of Ruby isn&rsquo;t likely to be a big win for me; I can&rsquo;t imagine a terribly large number of situations in which I&rsquo;d need this functionality, but for that handful of cases, it is spectacularly useful.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;We learned a valuable lesson today&rdquo;</h2>

<p>More than just learning a bit of Ruby trivia, I hope this story shows a little about my process for learning.</p>

<h3>Spot the oddity, and move on</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get distracted from the task you were attempting to accomplish. Time box yourself to 5 or 10 minutes, and if you haven&rsquo;t solved why it&rsquo;s behaving the way it is, but have an alternate solution, simply tuck the bizarre code away somewhere for future research.</p>

<h3>Create a hypothesis and experiment</h3>

<p>Use the tried and true Scientific Method. Think about the language you&rsquo;re working in normally behaves; what causes similar effects? What might be the behavior, given the outcome? Then consider how you could test that idea; if the language works the way you think it does, what would happen in the REPL if you changed an input value, or how you worked with the result?</p>

<h3>Read the docs</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s rare to have a language, framework, or library without some kind of documentation. Identify what the best resources are for your particular case &ndash; online, desktop app like Dash, command-line man pages, or even documentation that ships inside a REPL. Learn how to read the documentation source you choose, how to search, navigate, and expand definitions, and read it when you&rsquo;re surprised by something, <em>even when you think you won&rsquo;t understand it.</em></p>

<h3>Imagine a reason or use case</h3>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve learned how it behaves and played with it (either in a REPL or small mock-up script or application) try to imagine the use case for why this feature was built. What problems were other developers having that the language or framework&rsquo;s core team were attempting to address? Seeing the context of why you&rsquo;d use a particular feature helps to understand why it behaves the way it does.</p>

<h3>Share the knowledge</h3>

<p>Write up a blog post, tweet out a &ldquo;Did you know&hellip;&rdquo; gist, or even just talk about it with your peers on Slack or IRC. Sure, someone might say &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t believe you didn&rsquo;t know that&rdquo; but people who feign surprise are jerks and you should feel free to ignore this boorish behavior. Besides, no matter how new you are, it&rsquo;s likely that at least one other person DIDN&rsquo;T know about it or could use the reminder. Furthermore, you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s trying to give back to the community by share the knowledge and teaching, so in the end it&rsquo;s you who is the awesome gold star developer, not them. Own it!</p>

    <id>http://kerrizor.com/blog/2014/04/12/pair-programming-peanut-butter-and-jelly-sandwiches</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For this activity, pairs will work together to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. <!-- more --> One person will give instructions on how to make the sandwich while the other is tasked with carrying out those instructions. The one giving instructions can not touch the ingredients or tools, and the one receiving instructions can not speak back.</p>

<p>When one half of the sandwich is complete (or when you deem it time), switch roles. When the sandwich is completely assembled, switch roles again and proceed to cut the sandwich in half.</p>

<h3>For the Instruction Giver</h3>

<p>When listing the steps in your procedure, you should assume the person following your instructions is as &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; as a computer (IE &mdash; someone unfamiliar with making a sandwich, like an alien from another planet.)</p>

<h3>For the Instruction Receiver</h3>

<p>When following the instructions, interpret them as literally as possible. Messes are acceptable (even expected!)</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<p>While a computer has no &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; that would allow it to correctly guess your intent, we can assume a certain knowledge of these basic actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>open any container</li>
<li>close any container</li>
<li>hold a thing</li>
<li>pick up a thing</li>
<li>put a thing down</li>
<li>spread a condiment</li>
</ul>


<p>What we&rsquo;re missing is timing, amounts, and other interactive qualities. For example, we can say &ldquo;spread the jelly&rdquo; and assume the Receiver knows how to work their muscles, but will continue to &ldquo;spread the jelly&rdquo; all over everything within arms reach unless or until given a condition to cease.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>explore pair communication skills</li>
<li>expose communication assumptions</li>
<li>practice expressing commands in an explicit manner</li>
</ul>


<h2>Extending The Exercise</h2>

<ul>
<li>blindfold the Receiver, such that the Instruction Giver has to be more explicit with positional information and conditional checking</li>
<li>have the Instruction Giver stand with their back to the Receiver, so that they can not see the sandwich being assembled</li>
<li>have an instructor act as a Product Owner, who can be questioned about any aspect of the sandwich making process, and who can reject the sandwich for any of the following:

<ul>
<li>wrong kind of

<ul>
<li>peanut butter</li>
<li>jelly</li>
<li>bread</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>incorrectly cut</li>
<li>insufficient amount of condiment</li>
<li>overabundance of condiment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://kerrizor.com/blog/2013/08/02/practice-makes-perfect/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-02T14:58:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kerrizor.com/blog/2013/08/02/practice-makes-perfect</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post originally appeared on the <a href="http://www.bluebox.net/about/blog/2012/06/practice-make-perfect/">Blue Box blog</a></em></p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, there is no such thing as “on the job training.” The skills that differentiate senior and lead developers from the herd don’t come from sheer number hours spent simply doing the job. You will pick up a lot of exposure to concepts, techniques, and processes that way, but without focused, deliberate practice, you’re just spinning your wheels.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When you’re working, the goals are to accomplish the task, avoid failure, and get things done. Space to truly engage in learning is incidental. You are in the closed mode; “don’t distract me, I’m on a mission!” Practice, on the other hand, is about working on a problem with the idea of exploring the problem area, of learning something, and your goal, oddly enough, is to Deliberately Fail.</p>

<p>At Blue Box Group, we have the usual geek clubhouse toys — a MAME cabinet with 1200+ video games, ping-pong, a kegerator (with two varieties of beer!), and a rather nice billiards table, which is our primary obsession these days. Not content with the classic pool hall games of 8-ball, 9-ball, or cut-throat, we play a peculiar game invented by our Principal Technologist we call “Calvin Pool.” The rules are simple – after the break, the person whose turn it is has to attempt to simply hit whichever ball on the table their opponent chooses with the cue ball. There are a few wrinkles, naturally, but more or less the game boils down to “try to make the most difficult shot possible.”</p>

<p>I can’t even begin to tell you how much my game has improved in the last few weeks. I’m making shots that long stymied me, shots that intimidate and impress people who are occasional players of the game. The practice of setting myself up to fail and practicing the difficult, exploring the various possible approaches to seemingly impossible problems, has made me confident when dealing with the easy obstacles.</p>

<p>Similarly, when practicing programming, you need to challenge yourself to learn through exploration and trials, and accept that, as often as not, failure is going to be your ultimate outcome. If you’re not failing, you’re not practicing – you’re just warming up. So, how does someone practice the art and skill of programming? Here are a couple ideas.</p>

<h3>Limit yourself</h3>

<p>Decide for an afternoon, a day, or even a week, you’re going to use a technique you’re unfamiliar with. Make life hard for yourself on purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li>MONKEY PATCH ALL THE THINGS!</li>
<li>Make everything a gem</li>
<li>TDD the living snot out of the next bug you fix</li>
<li>Use an IDE you don’t normally use for a month</li>
<li>Don’t use the letter ‘G’</li>
<li>Make all actions happen through observers</li>
</ul>


<p>By forcing yourself to find new patterns to solve your problems, you’ll quickly run into the current limits of your knowledge and experience, and push out past them.</p>

<h3>Have some fun while doing something dumb!</h3>

<p>Extend your practice by choosing a simple problem and keep solving it in new ways. Each time, add complications and obstructions. Solve a problem over and over, with new obstacles. For instance, let’s take this User Story as a place to start:</p>

<p>“The user will be able to convert a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit, and vice versa.”</p>

<p>Simple enough. Five minutes (or less) of Googling will turn up a myriad of solutions, and give you the basic math. Start with making it a small command-line app – easy-peasy lemon-squeezy! Once that’s done (you did tests, too, right?), let’s mutate it and iterate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make it a gem</li>
<li>Release it on Github</li>
<li>Make it a website</li>
<li>Make it a mix-in on Numeric</li>
<li>Make it a web service</li>
<li>Find other temperature scales you could convert to and from</li>
<li>Have it attempt to resolve the user’s location via browser location or IP address, and give automated temperature conversions</li>
<li>Have it query wikipedia (or other data source) to offer information about the resulting temperature – trivia, facts, elements that melt or ignite or freeze at that temp, etc</li>
<li>Have it record the average, median, and min/max the user has calculated, and say witty things as milestones are passed</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>


<p>Practice doesn’t have to be about flash cards and rote memorization. Try a little learning-by-doing, by applying concepts and techniques you want to try to your daily workflow but haven’t found the time for. Get your hands dirty and stretch outside your comfort zone, and approach previously solved and well-understood problems from a fresh perspective, to truly discover the benefits (and drawbacks) of approaches you’re unfamiliar with.</p>
